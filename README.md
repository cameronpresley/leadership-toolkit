# Leadership Toolkit

As a new leader, it can be difficult coming up with new processes and figuring out how to lead a team.

This repository contains the templates and processes that I've used to lead teams.

The goal is to help you establish a basecamp that you can use when you're creating a new team or inheriting an existing team.
